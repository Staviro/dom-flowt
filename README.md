DOM Flowt is a lightweight JavaScript library for performing animations on elements as they appear into a users view.

To use DOM Flowt in your project, download the ZIP file at **/content/js/lib/stable/**
Or you can download the JS and CSS files manually if you like.

**It is important to download both the CSS and JS and inject them into your project.**

DOM Flowt uses custom HTML attributes to make it super easy to use.
Here are some attributes you can use in DOM Flowt

1. dom-flowt-is-visible="false" 
2. dom-flowt-type="float-left"
3. dom-flowt-duration="800"

The above 3 would sit on one element and will be used together by the DOM Flowt JavaScript to use the appropriate animation.

**ENJOY USING DOM FLOWT! Remember to share it with others if you love it.**
